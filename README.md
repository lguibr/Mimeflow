# Mime Flow üï∫üíÉ

Welcome to **Mime Flow**! This versatile pose matching application lets you engage in an interactive way to practice and perfect your poses across various disciplines, from dance to martial arts, and yoga. Powered by cutting-edge technology, it's designed to adapt to your skills, helping you refine your movements with precision.

### Origin Story:

Mime Flow began as an innovation to overcome the limitations of traditional systems like Kinect and Just Dance, which were constrained by outdated games and music. Inspired by the need for a more adaptable and modern approach to pose matching, this project evolved from enhancing dance sessions to supporting a broad spectrum of physical activities.

### Key Features:

- **Universal Pose Matching:** Leverages TensorFlow.js with BlazePose for real-time feedback on a wide variety of physical activities. üåü
- **Progress Tracking:** Every move is scored based on its accuracy, helping you improve by understanding your performance in real time. üìä
- **Seamless User Experience:** React and Next.js provide a fluid, responsive interface that enhances your interaction without complexity. üåê
